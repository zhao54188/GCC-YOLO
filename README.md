# GCC-YOLO
This is the code of Global Contextual Attention Augmented YOLO with ConvMixer Prediction Heads for PCB Surface Defect Detection
Our model is developed based on YOLOv5 code.
The experimental data is based on the publicly available dataset from Peking University, and we have conducted data augmentation on this basis, resulting in a new dataset called PCB-EN.
